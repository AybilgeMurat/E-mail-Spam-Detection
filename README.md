# E-mail-Spam-Detection
Email has become one of the most important forms of communication. We receive many e-mails every day. Some of these fall into our spam box. Spam is one of the main threats to e-mail users. Links in spam emails can cause users to be redirected to websites with malware or phishing patterns, which can access and disrupt the recipient's computer system. These sites may also collect sensitive information. Therefore, an effective spam filtering technology is an important contribution to the sustainability of cyberspace and our society. There are many methods of spam filtering. In this project, an algorithm was established over the data set, choosing content-based filtering among them.
